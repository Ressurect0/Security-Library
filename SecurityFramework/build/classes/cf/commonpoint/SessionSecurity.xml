            The secure flag is an option that can be set by the application server
             when sending a new cookie to the user within an HTTP Response. 
            The purpose of the secure flag is to prevent cookies from being observed by 
            unauthorized parties due to the transmission of a the cookie in clear text.
            To accomplish this goal, browsers which support the secure flag will only send cookies 
            with the secure flag when the request is going to a HTTPS page. Said in another way, 
            the browser will not send a cookie with the secure flag set over an unencrypted HTTP request.

            <!--
            If the HttpOnly flag (optional) is included in the HTTP response header, the cookie cannot be 
            accessed through client side script (again if the browser supports this flag). 
            As a result, even if a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists, and a user accidentally 
            accesses a link that exploits this flaw, the browser (primarily Internet Explorer) will not 
            reveal the cookie to a third party.
