(Common Point)- 
The main motive under which this Library is being developed is to facilitate Java Web Application developers to develope security solutions for their Web Application, without having to spend loads of time understanding and implementing those solutions.
It consists of various classes which the developers can use to embed code in their existing code and ensure safety practices.
This framework will mitigate all the most common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, Session-Hijacking, Password Hijacking, SQL Injection and many more.
